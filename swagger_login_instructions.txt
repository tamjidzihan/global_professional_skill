Here are the final steps to log in to the Swagger UI as an admin or user:

1.  **Ensure the Django Server is Running:**
    If your server is not already running, start it using the virtual environment's Python interpreter:
    ```bash
    D:\Tamzid\github\global_professional_skill\server\env\Scripts\python.exe manage.py runserver
    ```
    *(Remember to execute this command from the `D:\Tamzid\github\global_professional_skill\server` directory if using a separate terminal.)*

2.  **Create a User (if you don't have one):**
    *   **For an Admin User:**
        Open a new terminal (and navigate to `D:\Tamzid\github\global_professional_skill\server`), then run:
        ```bash
        D:\Tamzid\github\global_professional_skill\server\env\Scripts\python.exe manage.py createsuperuser
        ```
        Follow the prompts to create your admin account.
    *   **For a Regular User (Student/Instructor):**
        Use `curl` (or Postman, Insomnia, etc.) to register. *Remember to verify the email if your `EMAIL_BACKEND` is not `console.EmailBackend`. If it is `console.EmailBackend`, the verification link will appear in your server's terminal.*

        ```bash
        curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/accounts/register/ \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d '{
            "email": "your_email@example.com",
            "password": "YourStrongPassword123",
            "password_confirm": "YourStrongPassword123",
            "first_name": "Your",
            "last_name": "Name"
          }'
        ```

3.  **Obtain JWT Access Token by Logging In:**
    Use `curl` (or Postman, etc.) to log in with your registered user's credentials.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/accounts/login/ \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "email": "your_registered_email@example.com",
        "password": "YourStrongPassword123"
      }'
    ```
    From the JSON response, copy the value of the `access` token (it's a long string).

4.  **Clear Browser Cache (Important for UI Updates):**
    Before navigating to Swagger UI, it's a good practice to clear your browser's cache for `http://localhost:8000/`. This ensures that any old cached JavaScript or CSS related to `drf-yasg` is not used.

5.  **Authorize in Swagger UI:**
    *   Open your web browser and go to the Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/api/docs/`
    *   On the top right of the page, click the **"Authorize"** button.
    *   A dialog will appear. You should now see an input field labeled **"Value"** for **"Bearer"** authentication.
    *   Paste your copied `access` token into this **"Value"** field.
    *   Click **"Authorize"** and then **"Close"**.

You should now be able to use the authorized endpoints in Swagger UI. All requests made through Swagger UI will include the JWT token, allowing you to interact with protected API resources according to the permissions of the user you logged in as.
