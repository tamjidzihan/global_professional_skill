- **Error Analysis**: The backend error message `"{'profile_picture': [ErrorDetail(string='The submitted data was not a file. Check the encoding type on the form.', code='invalid')]"` indicated that the Django REST Framework was not receiving the uploaded file correctly. This typically happens when the `Content-Type` header for a request sending `FormData` is incorrectly set or overridden.
- **Root Cause Identification**: The `client/src/lib/api.ts` file had a default `Content-Type: 'application/json'` explicitly set in its `axios.create` configuration:
    ```typescript
    export const api = axios.create({
        baseURL: API_URL,
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json', // This was the culprit
        },
    });
    ```
    This explicit setting prevented `axios` from automatically detecting and setting the correct `Content-Type` header (`multipart/form-data`) when a `FormData` object was passed as the request body for file uploads.
- **Fix Implemented**: The explicit `Content-Type: 'application/json'` header was removed from the `axios.create` configuration in `client/src/lib/api.ts`.
    ```typescript
    export const api = axios.create({
        baseURL: API_URL,
        headers: {
            // 'Content-Type': 'application/json', // Removed to allow Axios to manage for FormData
        },
    });
    ```
    By removing this explicit header, `axios` is now able to correctly determine and set the appropriate `Content-Type` header, `multipart/form-data`, when a `FormData` object is passed as the request data. This allows the backend to correctly parse the incoming file data.
- **Verification**: After applying the fix, the TypeScript compiler ran successfully with no errors, confirming the change was syntactically correct. The backend error related to file submission should now be resolved.
