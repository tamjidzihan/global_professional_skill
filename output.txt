- **`client/src/hooks/useInstructorRequests.tsx`**: This hook was significantly enhanced.
    - It now imports `useAuth` to automatically fetch instructor requests pertaining to the currently logged-in user.
    - The `fetchInstructorRequests` function was updated to accept an optional `specificUserId` for filtering, defaulting to the authenticated user's ID if not provided.
    - Functionality to `submitInstructorRequest` was added, which wraps the `createInstructorRequest` API call and manages its own submission state (`isSubmitting`, `submitError`, `submitSuccess`).
    - An `useEffect` was included to trigger an initial fetch of requests when the component mounts and the user is authenticated.
- **`client/src/main/pages/dashboard/StudentDashboard.tsx`**:
    - The enhanced `useInstructorRequests` hook was imported and utilized.
    - New icons (`Briefcase`, `Sparkles`, `AlertCircle`) were imported from `lucide-react`.
    - A dedicated "Instructor Application Status" section was integrated into the student dashboard. This section intelligently displays:
        - Loading and error states during data fetching.
        - The status of the student's most recent instructor request (e.g., "Pending Review", "Approved!", "Rejected").
        - For rejected requests, it shows the `review_notes` and provides a link to re-apply.
        - If no instructor request is found, it presents a clear "Become an Instructor" call to action with a link to the `/apply-as-instructor` page.
    - The complex conditional rendering logic within this section was carefully wrapped in an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) to ensure it is syntactically valid JSX and compiles correctly.

All changes have been successfully implemented and the project compiles without errors. The student dashboard now effectively displays relevant instructor application information and provides a pathway for students to apply to become instructors.
